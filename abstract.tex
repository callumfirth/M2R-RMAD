\maketitle

In this project, we have set out to implement Reverse Mode Algorithmic Differentiation, and using our implementation, demonstrate why and how it is used in preference to other methods. We start off by creating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from the functions we want to differentiate. We created evaluation functions, one went forward through the tree, applying the mathematical functions to give us a single output, and the other went backward through the graph and evaluated each elementary operation as its adjoint, in other words, we took the derivative of each elementary operation, and multiplied through to, using the chain rule, give us our final derivatives. From there we both proved the accuracy of our code, using a Taylor Test and demonstrated the time efficiency of our algorithm by comparing it to how long the forward mode algorithmic differentiation code to run.

We then look at extensions of our implementation and also looking at how we can implement PDE's into our expressions. Notably, the one-dimensional Advection-Diffusion equation.
