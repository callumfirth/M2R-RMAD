% This may all change but:


% Intro
% Im thinking we start with a brief overview on why care about derivatives and the types of func we are caring about (ie. these are the R^n to R^1 func or similar)
% Then maybe move to the DAG representation of expressions (Talk about how we did this, why dag better)
% 

% RM
% See if we can create a gif? of a traversal of a DAG
% Show both the forward pass to evaluate it and then the backward pass
% Then maybe compare this to the forward mode gif
% Breifly mention complexity of the two algorithms (maybe only care about time here)
% Then talk about difference in time of the two algorithms

% Demo (May swap with conclusion/applications)
% Show basic derivative calculation (think of a nice function so we can easily confirm this)
% Move on to show difference in time between RM and FM (can be for a simple ex of n = 50)
% If completed in time show ODE equation/simulation

% Conclusion/Applications
% Mention theory behind ODE stuff
% Mention theory why we care about the neural network stuff
% Talk about neural networks maybe application on backpropagation, reducing loss func, optimising weights etc
