# M2R-RMAD

Rough Todo List:

Paper:
1. Tidy up first 2 sections
2. Create table for example in Section 5.1
3. Tidy up and expand section 5
4. Fnish Section 6
5. Show results from the implementation, specifically compare time taken
6. Move taylor stuff to later on, perhaps after implementation. 

Implementation:
1. If all previous done and enough time, start to try and implement Matrix multiplication as Ax. Would be like sin and only take one operand which is x. And the operator will have a value A that it applies to? Can do this as we dont care about the adjoint of A?
