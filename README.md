# M2R-RMAD

Rough Todo List:

Paper:
1. Create table for example in Section on Applying AD to DAG's: Example of FM
2. Tidy up and expand Section on Applying AD to DAG's
3. Tidy up Section on Implementation of scalar AD
4. Tidy up Section on Implementation of multi dim AD
5. Section on difference in runtime, change image, maybe compare not just scalar but multi dim AD too
6. Finish/Start initial type up of implementation of our Advection Diffusion Equation

Implementation:
1. If all previous done and enough time, start to try and implement Matrix multiplication as Ax. Would be like sin and only take one operand which is x. And the operator will have a value A that it applies to? Can do this as we dont care about the adjoint of A?
2. ODE Advection Diffusion Equation
3. Merge all demonstrations, examples and output to one section

Oral:
1. Work out how to use Beamer (put presentation into own folder on git)
2. Get rough plan of the slides and the general flow of the presentation
3. Get rough plan of the demo we are going to use and what we will show
